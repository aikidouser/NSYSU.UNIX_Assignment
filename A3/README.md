The goal of this new assignment is to creating a mostly-working game by modifying "hereitems" and "i", as well as implementing "get" and "drop".
You have probably read the earlier postings to cyberuniversity. The files contained in this tar file are unchanged from those.
But, in case you haven't read them, here is a full summary of all of the posts.

Looking at the files in this tarred directory, you will see:

```bash
   % ls
   PA1.tar              README_for_get.txt
   PA3walkthrough.txt   README_for_hereitems.txt
   README.txt           README_for_i.txt
   README_for_drop.txt  walkthroughComparisonToRealGame.txt
   %
```

One of the provided files is a new PA1.txt, which has added subdirectories named "get" and "There is a" into the dunnet directory.
Use this version of PA1.tar for this assignment.

To start understanding the assignment,

1. you should read PA3walkthrough.txt, then walkthroughComparisonToRealGame.txt.
2. Then you should implement the easier aliases first.
3. Therefore, first do the "i" alias and check that it works.
4. Then do the "drop" alias.
5. Then do the "get" alias.
6. Then do the "hereitems" alias.

Good luck. Please email me questions (in English) at stevewhaga@yahoo.com.

Remember to also study for your midterm.
